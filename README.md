This Python script fetches cryptocurrency futures data from the Bitget API and identifies assets that are overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30) in real time based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator.

Prerequesites for use include having Python 3.7+, installing the pandas and pybitget libraries through pip and creating a Bitget API key (if you want to automate trades through this script).

To run the script you simply input "python script.py" in your terminal.

Please reach out if you run into any issues while running the code or have reccommendations!
